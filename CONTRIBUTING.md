## Develop locally

After cloning the repository, you can start developing locally for the model cards website.

The website is built with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) and displays model cards and benchmarking results. It uses TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and is configured as a static site adapter for deployment.

### Installation

To install the development environment for the static website:

```shell
$ npm install
```

This will install all dependencies including Svelte, SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and development tools.

### Development

Start the development server with hot module replacement:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173` by default. The site will automatically reload when you make changes to files in the `src/` directory.

### Building

To create a production build of the static site:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

This generates static files in the `build/` directory that can be deployed to any static hosting service.

### Preview

To preview the production build locally:

```shell
$ npm run preview
```

This serves the built static files so you can test the production build before deployment.

### Code Quality

Before committing changes, ensure your code passes all quality checks:

```shell
# Type check with TypeScript and Svelte
$ npm run check

# Type check in watch mode
$ npm run check:watch

# Format code with Prettier (auto-fix)
$ npm run format

# Lint code with Prettier and ESLint
$ npm run lint
```

**Note:** Prettier is configured to only format files in the `src/` directory and specific config files. Python, YAML, and benchmark-related files are excluded. See [.prettierignore](.prettierignore) for details.
